# Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I had a lot of fun and at the same time hard times during this project, my motivation was to turn it in before the due date, and thankfully I did. I created this project because I feel like we all need a place to put down our notes in an orderly fashion and me personally will be using this pretty often. I think this will help students out there with problmes to have organized notes. I learned a lot of thing throughout this project as my first ever project i can say I love doing this and I learned a lot about the basics of coding.
